    <h5><b>Published May 12, 2022<b></h5>

<p><h3><i>Sony officially deployed a brand new System Software Update for the PS5 on Thursday, May 12, which once again simply improves the system performance of the console.

It isn’t just the PlayStation 5 that received a brand new update this week either. Fans were left rather puzzled after both the PlayStation 3 and PS Vita received new updates a few days ago, with some rather questionable changes in the patch.

The update, which brought the PS3 to version 4.89, made a chance to the account management section of the console. As of the latest system software update, players were no longer able to create brand new accounts directly from their PS3 or PS Vita. Instead, they would be forced to use a computer or mobile device.</i></h3>
